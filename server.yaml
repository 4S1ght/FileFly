# This is a configuration file holding all the core server configuration.
# It can be edited from within the server UI or manually - in which case
# a server restart is needed.


# Security ====================================================================


# Defines whether to use HTTPS (encrypted) or HTTP (unencrypted) connections.
# Turning this setting off may expose the server's user information, passwords,
# session IDs and other sensitive information. 
use_https: true

http_port: 443

# Specifies where to source the SSL certificate from.
# Available options are:
# 1. self-signed - The server will generate its own SSL encryption certificates.
# 2. external - The server will use an external certificate and private key.
#    Use "ssl_external_cert" and "ssl_external_pkey" to specify their location.
# Note: All of the following below SSL settings only apply when 
# "ssl_source_type" is set to "self-signed".
ssl_source_type: self-signed

# Specifies the absolute path of an external SSL certificate.
ssl_external_cert: /etc/ssl/certs/cert.pwm

# Specifies the absolute path of an external SSL private key.
ssl_external_pkey: /etc/ssl/certs/pkey.pem

# Specifies the lifetime of the SSL certificate generated by automatically
# by Filefly whenever it's configured to use a self-signed certificate.
ssl_lifetime_days: 365

# Specifies the encryption algorithm used for network communication.
# Available options are: sha256, sha384, sha512
ssl_alg: sha256

# Specifies the key size - Larger sizes provide higher encryptions strength, 
# but also higher communication latency.
ssl_key_size: 4096

# Certificate owner's name.
ssl_common_name: Filefly

# Certificate owner's operating country.
ssl_country_name: N/A

# Certificate owner's operating locality, such as state or province.
ssl_locality_name: N/A

# Certificate owner's organization.
ssl_organization_name: N/A

# Salt rounds used when hashing user user passwords
# This setting does not contribute to overall security, but greatly increases
# the time a potential attacker would need to guess user passwords 
# - This also means legitimate login attempts will take longer due to longer
#   process of hashing the password provided by the user.
bcrypt_password_salt_rounds: 12


# Logging ====================================================================


# Specifies the level of logs emitted to the server console.
# Levels include - crit, error, warn, notice, info, http, debug
log_console_level: debug

# Specifies the level of logs emitted to log files.
# Levels include - crit, error, warn, notice, info, http, debug
log_file_level: info

# Specifies the maximum size of each log file.
log_file_size: 100MB

# Specifies the maximum amount of log files stored.
# This can be a number of files or number of days. If using days, add 'd' 
# as the suffix.
