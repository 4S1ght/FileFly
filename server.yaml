# Specifies where to source the SSL certificate from.
# Available options include:
# 1. self-signed - The server will generate its own SSL encryption certificates.
# 2. external - The server will use an external certificate and private key.
#    Use "ssl_external_cert" and "ssl_external_pkey" to specify their location.
#
# Note: All of the following SSL settings only apply when "ssl_source_type" 
# is set to "self-signed".
ssl_source_type: self-signed

# Specifies the absolute path of an external SSL certificate.

# Specifies the lifetime of the SSL certificate generated by automatically
# by Filefly whenever it's configured to use a self-signed certificate.
ssl_lifetime_days: 365

# Specifies the encryption algorithm used.
# Available options include: sha256, sha384, sha512
ssl_alg: sha256

# Specifies the key size - Larger sizes provide higher encryptions strength, 
# but also higher communication latency.
