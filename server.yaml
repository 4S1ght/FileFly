# by Filefly whenever it's configured to use a self-signed certificate.
ssl_lifetime_days: 365

# Specifies the encryption algorithm used.
# Available options include: sha256, sha384, sha512
ssl_alg: sha256

# Specifies the key size - Larger sizes provide higher encryptions strength, 
# but also higher communication latency.
ssl_key_size: 4096
